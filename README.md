# Titanic
**PROJECT: Predicting-Survivors-on-Titanic-using-Logistic-Regression-and-Machine-Learning**  
  
>`PROBLEM STATEMENT: As a Data Scientist you are trying to predict a classification: survival or deceased, of the passengers onboard the Titanic on its last trip. In this project you will be working with the Titanic Data Set from Kaggle. This is a very famous data set and very often is a student's first step in machine learning.`

We are using a "semi-cleaned" version of the titanic data set, if we use the data set hosted directly on Kaggle, we may need to do some additional cleaning not shown in this project notebook.

Tools Used in this Project are:

**Linear Regression with Scikit Learn - Machine Learning with Python  
1.Python Pandas    
2.Python Numpy  
3.Python Matplotlib  
4.Python Seaborn  **
  
  
The following topics are covered in this project:

`1.A typical problem statement for machine learning  `  
`2.Downloading and exploring a dataset for machine learning  `
`3.Cleaning, Transforming and Preparing the data for Machine Learning`  
`4.Logistic regression with one variable using Scikit-learn ` 
`5.Logistic regression with multiple variables`  
`6.Using categorical features for machine learning  `
`7.Regression coefficients and feature importance ` 
`8.Creating a training and test set for reporting results  `
  
**Once our model has been created and trained using the test dataset we can use our model to easily predict the classification of passengers into Survived or Deceased.
